# Kingcamp sleeping bag

Purchased in June 2023 from osta.ee. Only used a handful of times and not dirty at all. And I'm a clean person! I swear.

It's a three-season sleeping bag, so obviously it isn't warm enough to sleep outside in when it's -20°. But if that's your thing, maybe you should seek psychological help.

Bottom zips open so you can let your smelly feet air out while keeping the rest of your body warm.

Also comes with a stuff sack as shown in the photos.

Purchased for around €20-25 including shipping, but can be yours for the low, low price of €10. That's over a 50% discount, you cheap b@stards.

Sex never took place in this sleeping bag (I'm saving myself for marriage if you must know).

Retail price is in the €35 range.

# HP USB Business Slim Smartcard Keyboard, Nordic layout

Very clean and in excellent condition, every key is perfect. Will help you type faster, become more attractive to the opposite (or same) sex and just be a better human being overall.

Retails for about $45, but can be yours for the low, low price of €10.

https://www.amazon.com/USB-Slim-Ccid-Smartcard-Kyd/dp/B06WRN6RTM

P0rn was never browsed using this keyboard. But nobody's judging if you decide to (just know that God is watching...you sicko)

# Kinesis Freestyle 2 Keyboard, US layout

Are you sick and tired of the weirdly shaped Enter key on Nordic keyboards? Is the tiny left shift key chapping your caboose?

Well then do I have the solution for you!

Presenting the coolest, most ergonomical keyboard you'll ever have typed an email or harassed people on Reddit with. Typing with your arms shoulder width apart rather than cramped together like "normal" keyboards is much more ergonimical, attractive and good for your self-esteem.

Retails for about $89, but can be yours for the low, low price of €10.

https://www.amazon.com/Freestyle2-Ergonomic-Keyboard-Standard-Separation/dp/B00CMALD3E

Obviously this keyboard is a bit dinged up and missing a couple of useless keys, but it still types amazingly. And it'll help you type faster, get better grades in school, earn more money and overall become a better person.

P0rn was never browsed using this keyboard. But nobody's judging if you decide to (just know that God is watching, you sicko...)

# MacBook Pro Charger

This charger is gently used. It says it's a 60-watt MagSafe power adapter. I used it with my 13" MBP but I'm sure it can be used with any MacBook that connects to a magnetic DC connector. 

Excellent condition

€20

Note: it has a US power adapter, which means you have three options: 
1. Swap out the US power adapter for an EU version
2. Use a US-to-EU adapter
3. Don't buy it at all ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# Black Crescent Starren Hybrid Bicycle

### SOLD!

~~This bike is incredible. It's a tank. It's basically a two-wheeled version of a Volvo (pre-Ford and Geely). It's indestructible. I've ridden this bike all over Estonia, literally.~~

~~I bought it used in 2019 from Kauplus Jalgrattas. I paid close to €400, including the bike, the lock, the bell, the headlight and the taillight. I bought the extras that you'll read about below separately.~~

~~Since that time, it's been my primary form of transportation in and around Tartu, as well as the vehicle I've used to explore Estonia. I've ridden from Valga to Tartu, Tallinn to Tartu, Koidula to Tartu, Viljandi to Tartu, Tallinn to Narva, Tartu to Valga, a six-day bike trip along the west coast of the country, Tartu to Pärnu and back, to Saadjärve a million different times, Tartu to Kallaste, Otepää a bunch of times as well as many more that I've forgotten. I could take it today for a long trip anywhere or a short trip to the grocery store with absolutely no issues.~~

~~It's got front shocks, disc brakes and a kickstand.~~

~~It's a larger bike, so if you're 150 cm tall, maybe this isn't the bike for you. But if you're a normally-proportioned adult, it'll probably feel great. Come give it a test ride and find out for yourself!~~

~~Of course I've had to put more money and maintenance into the bike over the last four years:~~
~~- the pedals are new this summer~~
~~- the back tire was replaced this summer~~
~~- the cassette (rear) and chain were replaced in the fall of 2022~~
~~- the rear derailleur (and possibly the rear derailleur hanger, I can't remember anymore) was replaced in 2020~~

~~However, the bike isn't perfect. While it can ride without any problems and can ride far, and all components currently work, it could use new handlebar grips; the right (rear) gear shifter could use an adjustment; the left (front) brake needs maintenance; the bell, while loud and functions perfectly, rattles while riding; and the taillight may need maintenance or to be replaced. That's all I can think of at the moment, but come take it for a test ride and see for yourself.~~

~~In addition to the lock (whose code can be reset!), the headlight and the taillight, it also comes with a hand bike pump, a tube patch kit, three patched tubes that inflate and currently hold air and chain grease.~~

~~It retails for around €1000, not including all the extras I'm throwing in for free:~~

~~https://www.bikeplanet.fi/crescent-starren-22~~

~~https://www.cykellagret.se/cyklar/crescent/crescent-sport-cyklar/crescent-starren-sport-cyklar~~

~~Here's the official description:~~

~~"Starren is a good choice no matter if you are thinking of starting exercise or need a reliable commuter bike. You get a fast, functional and safe hybrid bike that will take you where you want, for many years. The bike has 8 gears. This hybrid is equipped with a luggage rack with an AVS quick connector that allows you to attach a bag or basket with a single click. The flexible front fork combined with light, strong aluminum frame geometry and firm tires provide both control and a good feel for the gravel. And if you want to drive fast on asphalt, the fork is easy to lock. The handlebar, guide bracket and seat part are made of light and strong aluminum and are designed to give you a comfortable driving position that can be easily adjusted.~~

~~Lightweight aluminum frame, elastic fork~~
~~Clever, functional and simple Shimano Acera 8 transmission~~
~~Shimano MT201 hydraulic disc brakes~~
~~Protected tires, luggage rack, parking support"~~

~~Oh and I forgot to mention that contrary to popular belief, chicks really dig guys who ride bikes. First of all, they're environmentally friendly, and nothing makes a lady moister than protecting Mother Earth. Secondly, the less you spend on gas, the more money you have to wine and dine your special lady.~~

~~And ladies, we all know how much guys (and girls) dig a cutie riding around on a bike with her hair flowing in the wind.~~

~~Asking €225 or best offer. It's an amazing value and a steal at that price.~~

~~It's a plug-and-play bike that you can ride around today for a short ride to school/work or a long-distance ride to the other side of the country.~~

# Super awesome and cool Drying Rack
### SOLD!

~~There's nothing funny about this drying rack. Fact is, it dries your clothes super fast. Probably faster than an electric dryer. It's like you're hanging your clothes out to dry in the Sahara Desert. Best part is, it doesn't cost any money to use.~~

~~Pick up in Tartu.~~

~~They cost a fortune now at Jysk: https://www.jysk.ee/jolly-kuivatusrest-109134-ee.html. Some go for €20-40~~

~~I paid around €10, but it can be yours for the low, low price of €5.~~
