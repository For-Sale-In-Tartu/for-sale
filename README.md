![take off that towel, cute girl](https://github.com/For-Sale-In-Tartu/for-sale/blob/e44b2b61b793f364aa558cdb061a3a55fdefa4dd/for-sale-item-photos/asiangirl.jpg?raw=true)

Premium high quality, multipurpose microfiber towels for women, men, kids, babies and even pets. 

Great for an active outdoor lifestyle, workout or regular bath and shower use.

You can wring out 90% of the water or sweat from a wet towel. 

This makes it quick to dry - 287% faster than cotton - leaving less time for mold and bacteria to grow. 

Resulting in a towel that is antibacterial, antimicrobial and odor-free.

The luxurious, lint-free, suede texture is very soft on the skin. 

It has a convenient hang loop for drying, and requires minimal water for washing, making it eco friendly.

Compared to a cotton towel, it takes up 87% less storage space, is 60% lighter weight and packs tight for its large size.
